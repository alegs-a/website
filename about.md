# About me

I'm a CS student with an interest in maths, low-level design and most things that aren't front-end (that's why this site uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)).

I'm also a choral singer and violist. Music I'm listening to at the moment includes:
- Britten - *Hymn to St Cecilia*
- Ravel - *Daphnis et Chloé*
